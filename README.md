# Multi-Instance EC2 Deployment with Terraform and Ansible for Scalability of Web Applications

This project encompasses the following objectives:

- Automating the creation of three (3) EC2 instances behind an Application Elastic Load Balancer using Terraform and Ansible for the scalability of web applications.

- Procuring a preferred domain, hosted with AWS Route53 within the Terraform plan. Adding an A record for the subdomain "terraform-test" that points to the ELB IP address.

- Creating an Ansible script utilizing the host-inventory file generated by Terraform. The script installs Apache, sets the timezone to Africa/Lagos, and displays a simple HTML page on all 3 EC2 instances.

- The scaled website is accessible via terraform-test.domain.com and displays content from the created instances. It dynamically rotates between the servers as the website is refreshed to showcase their unique content.
